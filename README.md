## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tasmota-updater.git
cd tasmota-updater

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the web interface
python app.py
```

Then visit http://localhost:5001 in your browser.

## üîÑ Development with VS Code

This project includes VS Code tasks:

1. **Automatic Development Server**: The Flask development server starts automatically when you open the project in VS Code.

2. **Additional Tasks**: You can also run these tasks manually from the VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`):
   - `Start Flask Development Server`: Basic Flask server with auto-reload
   - `Setup Development Environment`: Install required dependencies

The development server will automatically reload when code changes are detected, making the development process faster and more efficient.

## üß™ Development Mode

The application includes a development mode that uses fake devices instead of connecting to real Tasmota devices. This is useful for testing the UI and functionality without needing actual hardware.

### Using Development Mode

You can enable development mode by setting the `DEV_MODE` environment variable to `true` or by using the provided `.env.dev` file:

```bash
# Use the development environment configuration
ENV_FILE=.env.dev python app.py
```

In development mode:

1. The application loads devices from `devices-dev.yaml` instead of `devices.yaml`
2. No actual API calls are made to physical devices
3. Fake device information is used for testing all features

### Environment Configuration

The application uses `.env` files for configuration:

- `.env` - Default configuration (production mode)
- `.env.dev` - Development configuration with fake devices

You can specify which environment file to use with the `ENV_FILE` environment variable:

```bash
ENV_FILE=.env.dev python app.py
```

### Configuring Fake Devices

Fake devices are defined in `devices-dev.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
devices:
  - ip: 192.168.100.101
    username: admin
    password: password
    fake: true
    dns_name: fake-tasmota-light1.local
    firmware_info:
      version: "12.0.2"
      core_version: "2.7.4.9"
      sdk_version: "3.0.2"
      is_minimal: false
```

You can modify this file to simulate different device configurations and firmware versions.
